# Django Ecommerce Website with Stripe Payment Integration
I have create a basic Ecommerce Website using the Django and for payment gateway i have used <b>stripe</b>, where we can<br>
>login/logout, register new user on site
>search on site<br>
>add to cart<br>
>increment or decrement the quantity of product<br>
>finally checkout by using stripe payment gateway (It's for demo purpose only) <br>

In this site, I have use tailwind CSS  https://tailwindcss.com/ for css and HTMX https://htmx.org/ rather than using javascript.
